            What Is Connectify?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-body text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            Connectify is a fully functioning social media platform designed to
            bring people together (or, you know, keep you endlessly scrolling).
            But here's the twist: it's also a portfolio project. Yes, everything
            works, but more than that, it&apos;s been an amazing learning
            experience.
          </p>
          <p className="text-body text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            From building complex user interfaces to tackling backend logic,
            Connectify represents a journey of web development growth. It&apos;s
            not just about social networking; it's about pushing boundaries,
            solving problems, and learning a ton along the way.

            Why a Portfolio Project?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-body leading-relaxed">
            Connectify was built not only to mimic a social platform but also to
            sharpen my skills as a developer. Think of it as a social app with
            an educational twist. The goal? To experiment with various web
            technologies and frameworks, and maybe — just maybe — impress a few
            recruiters.
          </p>
          <p className="text-body leading-relaxed mt-4">
            If you&apos;re here, know that this platform isn&apos;t just for
            likes and comments; it&apos;s also about growth, perseverance, and
            overcoming the occasional bug-induced meltdown.

                Some features were inspired by actual social media giants... and
